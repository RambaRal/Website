# Spartronics5048.com Gihub Repository

This is the full contents of spartronics5048.com (or will be, once we upload this and replace the old one.) Team members feel free to edit this site; it will hopefully be automatically synced with the web server once I figure out how to set that up. Outsiders can add suggestions and submit patches, but keep in mind that there's a good chance we'll reject it if it isn't up to our snuff.

All material, unless otherwise stated, is under copyright of their respective creators. (We may change this in the future to be Creative Commons or the like; it's something we've gotta discuss.)
